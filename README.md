# Startups profit prediction using Multiple Linear Regression
Using a mean square error “MSE” function to calculate the error between true and predict values in Regression Model  


#  Question1

	For (R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and	State column as input and profit is output:
    a.	Remove the null value. “Replace it with most repeated value”.
    b.	Encoding the string value
    c.	Split value of dataset (80% for training and 20% testing)
    d.	Make a regression model to predict the test value.
    e.	Create a mean square error “MSE” function to calculate the error between true and predict values. 


#  Question2

    For (R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and	State column as input and decision is output:
    a.	Remove the null value. “Replace it with average value”.
    b.	Split value of dataset (70% for training and 30% testing)
    c.	Make a regression model to predict the test value.
    d.	Create a mean square error “MSE” function to calculate the error between true and predict values.
